# Technical experience

Currently I am a sophomore at IIEST Shibpur, India. My area of interest lies in Machine Learning, Data Science, Web Development and Artificial Intelligence. I have prior working experience with Python, Javascript, C and C++, though I am more comfortable in working with Python and Javascript.

# Experiences

# Past experience with conda-forge community

Conda-forge, an umbrella project of NumFOCUS, is a community effort that provides conda packages for a wide range of software. It is an amazing experience to get connected with such a community and contribute to such a huge project.

**Experience as a user:** For the first time I came to know about conda-forge when I started to set up my system to do Data Science works in Python. Previously I used to use package manager `pip`, which is the default package manager for new Python installations. I was suggested by my mentor to use `conda` instead of `pip` as it contains more features and resolves dependencies better.

After installing Miniconda, I wanted to create a new environment just for Data Analysis. At that time my mentor recommended me to install all the packages in the new environment only from `conda-forge`, not from the `defaults`. Using `conda-forge` consistently provided me with better package compatibility and nicer work experience in the new environment.

**Experience as a contributor:** Before starting to contribute to this community project, I had some experience in working on Open Source projects, mainly in github and gitlab communities. It was a pleasant experience to get connected to the conda-forge community. I am really thankful to the project mentor and all the collaborative community members for this. My main motivation behind applying for the Outreachy Program was to widen my knowledge about new technologies as well as to learn how to work and share knowledge with everyone in a community on a global scale. I tried to follow the discussions in the Gitter channel, which helped me to understand the project better and improve myself to help even more.

# Past experience with other communities

I have some experience as a user as well as a contributor with **OpenFPGA framework**. It is the first open-source FPGA(Field Programmable Gate Analysis) IP generator supporting highly-customizable homogeneous FPGA architectures. OpenFPGA provides a full set of EDA support for customized FPGAs, including Verilog-to-bitstream generation and self-testing verification.

While learning Object-oriented and functional programming style, I came to know about **OCaml Language**. OCaml is an industrial-strength programming language supporting functional, imperative and object-oriented styles. It was quite different from what I already knew(Procedural Programming), which is why it took me some time to appreciate and understand the concept. But at the same time it was quite easy to learn and understand unlike some other functional languages. Later I used Ocaml to develop a simple Program Analyzer.

**SymPy** is another open-source application, which I have used while exploring Symbolic Mathematics in Python. SymPy is a Python library for Symbol Mathematics which aims to become a full-featured CAS(Computer Algebra System). In my Machine Learning projects, I have used SymPy for Algebraic Manipulations, Equation Solving and Calculus(Differentiation, Integration, Series Expansion etc.).

# Relevant Projects

As I mentioned previously, I have used conda-forge to build a robust environment for my Machine Learning, Data Analysis and Data Science projects(personal projects and college mini-project). Along with these projects, my university project **Design and Analysis of Algorithms** was developed in the same environment. I used conda-forge as the primary channel for installing and updating some common and useful Python packages like numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn and matplotlib(for visualization purpose). I used Jupyter Notebook as my computational notebook and editor.

Few packages were not explicitly included in the list of packages to install, but they were dependencies of at least one of the packages in the list of packages to install and were installed along with other dependencies.

The best thing about using conda-forge was that the core developer team takes care so that all the packages have compatible versions and are up-to-date.

# Community-specific Questions

# My vision of conda-forge

Though I am still exploring this project, I think one thing we can do to enhance the documentation is to improve the FAQ and glossary section. Beginners may often face technical issues when using conda-forge and feel lost. We may keep track about what all doubts are being asked in the Gitter channel and what are the solutions suggested by community members. These may be included in the FAQ section in question-answer format. Also, many additional information we can find in the discussions in the channel, which are not already included in docs. Mentioning these informations and keeping updating the docs seems to be very much important to me.

Also, I feel there should be a complete guide or tutorial kind of thing for the building process of a package recipe. This will be very helpful for beginners.

# Project Timeline

Phase 1 - May

Documenting or improving documentation of any project, especially such a huge community project like conda-forge requires deep knowledge about the project. It is very important to become familiar with the structure of conda-forge and be sure about what we aim to do in future. So, I would like to study every single thing about which I need to know in order to improve the documentation properly. I will become more clear about my future goals with the help of my mentor and other community members. I may be a bit busy during my exams at the end of this month, but I will give a generous amount of time to understand the project more.

Phase 2 - (June - August)

I will be working full-time on my project for these three months. I will actively participate in the open-source development process and write blog entries. Few tasks I am interested to perform during the intership period:

1. Writing a complete guide containing the actual steps and standard model for a package recipe, building process (just a simple discussion) and how conda-forge bot recognize defective licenses, recipes and packages in general.
2. Documenting any project(like auto-tick bot).
3. Including bug solutions and helpful ideas appeared in Gitter channel or github repositories and improving documentation.

I am open to learn about and work on any task according to the demand of the project and internship. The tasks mentioned above are simply examples of the type of tasks I am interested to perform.
