# Experiences

# Past experience with conda-forge community

Conda-forge, an umbrella project of NumFOCUS, is a community effort that provides conda packages for a wide range of software. It is an amazing experience to get connected with such a community and contributing to such a huge project.

**Experience as an user:** For the first time I came to know about conda-forge when I started to set up my system to do Data Science works in Python. Previously I used to use package manager `pip`, which is the default package manger for new Python installations. I was suggested by my mentor to use `conda` instead of `pip` as it contains more features and resolves dependencies better.

After installing Miniconda, I wanted to create a new environment just for Data Analysis. At that time my mentor recommended me to install all the packages in the new environment only from `conda-forge`, not from the `defaults`. Using `conda-forge` consistently provided me with better package compatibility and nicer work experience in the new environment.
